# Automated Food Warehouse Robot System

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to transform a conventional food storage warehouse into a fully automated facility with no human intervention. The system combines Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (AS/RS), robotic arms, and intelligent warehouse management software to enable high-throughput, hygienic, and safe operations.

## üìú Implementation Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

1. **Define Scope & Requirements**  
   - Identify product types (dry, chilled, frozen), throughput requirements, accuracy, and hygiene standards.  
   - Determine maximum payload, temperature conditions, and regulatory compliance.

2. **Survey & Data Collection**  
   - Map warehouse layout: dimensions, racks, aisles, dock locations, power sources, and environmental zones.  
   - Create CAD layout for planning.

3. **Select Automation Architecture**  
   - Choose between AS/RS, AMR fleets, or a hybrid system.  
   - Define rack design, aisle width, and equipment distribution.

4. **Specify Robot & Equipment Parameters**  
   - Define payload, reach, speed, sensors, materials, and operating environment.  
   - Select compliant food-grade materials.

5. **Control System & Software Design**  
   - Develop Warehouse Management System (WMS) integrated with Fleet Management.  
   - Implement communication protocols and real-time controls.

6. **Full System Simulation**  
   - Simulate robot paths, throughput, congestion, and safety scenarios.  
   - Validate against KPIs.

7. **Mechanical & Electrical Design**  
   - Generate CAD drawings and Bill of Materials (BOM).  
   - Select motors, controllers, and sensors.

8. **Prototype & Pilot Testing**  
   - Deploy a small-scale pilot area for evaluation.  
   - Monitor performance, adjust parameters.

9. **Validation & Approval**  
   - Conduct safety, accuracy, and endurance tests.  
   - Ensure compliance with food safety regulations.

10. **Deployment & Handover**  
    - Roll out to the entire warehouse.  
    - Train maintenance teams.

11. **Continuous Improvement**  
    - Gather operational data and optimize routing, scheduling, and energy usage.
